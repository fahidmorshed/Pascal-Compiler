It is a basic Pascal compiler -- include some basic features like algebraic operation,if else,while etc


Prerequisites:
	You should have lex and yacc at your computer.
	And to compile assembly code you must install 
	

What to do:

	1.Write the commands in terminal
		lex -l Lexfile.l
		yacc -d Parser.y
		g++ lex.yy.c y.tab.c
		./a.out <input.txt >output.txt



	2. Find the line in output.txt : In Program --> Start of Production Rule
		- This means you have successfully created assembly code (These were necessary for me to debug the code)
	
	Now upto this point(including the line) delete all
	now you will have the code and save it as input.asm
	
	4)Now Write the following commands in terminal:
	
		nasm -f elf input.asm
		ld -o ouput input.o
		./output 
		
		- You will get the output
		

NB: I have given a input.txt which outputs a fibonacci number for n = 8
